/// with real displacement and excellent periodicity.

/// Apple already ships a trained classifier for this, so the sensible move is to use
/// it. But it may equally misread a rhythmic set AS walking, which would suppress
/// real sets. So nothing is gated on it yet: it is recorded into every capture, and
/// what it actually does during real sets decides whether it can be trusted.
