/// The recording is uploaded on stop, labelled with whatever the rep watcher is armed
/// to. It reports no rep count and creates no logged set: this mode exists to capture
/// a movement the algorithm should be measured against, not to add training data.
///
/// It previously assigned the finished samples to a local array and dropped them. A
/// recording made here reached the quality summary and went no further, which made the
/// whole mode silently useless — the thing it exists to produce was never produced.
